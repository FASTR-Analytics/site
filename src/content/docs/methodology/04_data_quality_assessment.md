## Background and purpose

### Objective of the module

The Data Quality Assessment (DQA) module evaluates the reliability of routine Health Management Information System (HMIS) data reported by health facilities. It functions as an initial quality control step within the FASTR pipeline, reviewing monthly facility reports to identify data quality issues prior to their use in downstream analysis.

The module assesses data quality across three complementary dimensions: outliers, which identify unusually high reported values that may reflect reporting or data entry errors; completeness, which measures the regularity and continuity of facility reporting over time; and consistency, which evaluates whether related indicators exhibit expected relationships. These dimensions are combined into an overall DQA score, providing a standardized summary measure of data reliability.

Routine HMIS data are a primary source for monitoring health service delivery at both facility and population levels, capturing events such as immunizations delivered and births attended by skilled health personnel. As with all routinely collected data, HMIS data are subject to quality limitations. The FASTR DQA module applies a systematic review of monthly data at the facility and indicator levels to identify and characterize these limitations. Results are summarized as annual estimates, which may reflect partial-year data depending on data availability at the time of analysis (for example, analyses conducted mid-year may include data only for the months available).

### Analytical rationale

Data quality directly affects the reliability of health indicators and coverage estimates. Before service utilization rates or population coverage are calculated, it is necessary to assess whether the underlying facility data are sufficiently reliable. This module identifies data patterns that may distort analytical results, allowing users to make informed decisions about data treatment in subsequent steps of the pipeline.

### FASTR approach to data quality

FASTR takes a multi-pronged approach, based on the belief that data quality should not be a barrier to data use. The approach emphasizes conducting granular, facility-level data quality assessments; focusing on high-volume indicators that produce more stable estimates; emphasizing variation over time and space rather than point estimates; and interpreting results collaboratively with in-country decision-makers. Using data and providing feedback is viewed as the first step toward improving data quality.

### Key points

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Raw HMIS data (`hmis_ISO3.csv`) containing facility service volumes by month and indicator<br>Geographic/administrative area identifiers<br>Standardized indicator names |
| **Outputs** | `M1_output_outliers.csv` — facility-month-indicator outlier flags<br>`M1_output_outlier_list.csv` — flagged outliers only (review list)<br>`M1_output_completeness.csv` — facility-month-indicator completeness flags<br>`M1_output_consistency_geo.csv` — sub-national consistency results by ratio pair<br>`M1_output_dqa.csv` — composite DQA scores (mean and pass/fail) |
| **Purpose** | Evaluate HMIS data reliability through outlier detection, completeness assessment, and consistency checking to ensure trustworthy inputs for coverage estimation |

!!! warning "Reminder: input must be counts, not percentages"

    This module expects **raw service counts** (e.g. number of visits, doses, deliveries reported by each facility each month). Percentages, rates, or pre-calculated coverage figures cannot be analysed here — outlier detection compares values against a facility's own volume distribution (a percentage capped at 100 has no signal), and completeness flags depend on whether a count was reported. See [Data extraction](02_data_extraction) for what to pull from your HMIS.

## Analytical workflow

### Overview of analytical steps

The module applies a structured sequence of data quality checks, progressing from individual observations to an overall assessment of data reliability:

**Step 1: Data preparation**  
Monthly facility reports are loaded and organized for analysis. Dates are standardized, and the geographic units and health indicators available in the dataset are identified.

**Step 2: Outlier detection**  
For each facility and indicator (for example, pentavalent vaccine doses or antenatal care visits), the module identifies unusually high values that may reflect reporting or data entry errors. Two complementary approaches are used: statistical outlier detection based on deviations from a facility’s historical reporting pattern, and proportional checks that flag months accounting for an implausibly large share of the facility’s trailing 12-month service volume for that indicator.

**Step 3: Completeness assessment**  
The module evaluates the consistency of facility reporting over time by constructing a complete reporting timeline for each facility–indicator combination and identifying missing months. Facilities with extended periods of non-reporting (six months or more) are classified as inactive rather than incomplete.

**Step 4: Consistency assessment**  
Related indicators are expected to follow predictable relationships. For example, the number of first antenatal care visits should exceed the number of fourth visits. The module assesses these relationships using indicator ratios calculated at the district level, reducing bias from patient movement across facilities, and flags deviations from expected patterns.

**Step 5: Indicator availability checks**  
Before consistency assessments are applied, the module verifies that the required indicator pairs are present in the data. Where indicators are missing, the analysis adapts to the available information without generating errors.

**Step 6: DQA score calculation**  
For a defined set of core indicators (typically first-dose pentavalent vaccination, first antenatal care visit, and outpatient department visits), results from the outlier, completeness, and consistency checks are combined into an overall DQA score. A facility–month receives the highest score only if all core indicators meet minimum standards across all three dimensions.

**Step 7: Outputs**  
The module generates a set of structured outputs, including outlier flags, completeness indicators, consistency results, and final DQA scores. These outputs are used in subsequent FASTR modules and provide a transparent basis for data quality review and improvement.

### Key decision points

**When is a value considered an outlier?**

Outliers are identified by assessing within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator. A value is flagged as an outlier if it meets **either** of the following criteria:

1. The value exceeds 10 times the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the monthly median for the indicator; **or**  
2. The value accounts for more than 80 percent of the total reported volume for a given facility, indicator, and year **and** the reported count exceeds 100.

The MAD is calculated using only values at or above the median, in order to focus detection on unusually high values and avoid flagging low-volume observations.

**Why is consistency assessed at the district level rather than the facility level?**

Patients frequently seek care from different facilities within the same district depending on the service. For example, a woman may receive her first antenatal care visit at a primary health center but deliver at a district hospital. Assessing consistency at the district level accounts for this patient movement and provides a more accurate representation of service utilization patterns.

**What happens when required indicators are missing?**

The module adapts to the data that are available. If required indicator pairs for consistency assessment are missing, consistency checks are not applied, and the DQA score is calculated using only outlier and completeness dimensions. Analysis proceeds using the quality dimensions that can be assessed.

**How are inactive facilities handled?**

Facilities that do not report for six or more consecutive months at the beginning or end of their reporting period are classified as inactive for those months rather than incomplete. This prevents penalizing facilities that have not yet begun reporting or that have permanently ceased operations.

### Data processing and outputs

**Transformation overview**

The module transforms raw facility reports into quality-flagged datasets through the following steps:

1. **Input format**: Monthly observations with facility identifier, reporting period, indicator, and reported count  
2. **Enrichment**: Calculation of supporting statistics, including median values, MAD-based residuals, and proportional volume contributions  
3. **Completion**: Explicit generation of records for missing months, converting implicit reporting gaps into observable data points  
4. **Aggregation**: Aggregation of facility-level data to the district level for consistency assessment  
5. **Flagging**: Assignment of binary quality flags for outliers, completeness, and consistency  
6. **Scoring**: Combination of quality flags into continuous scores (0–1) and corresponding pass/fail indicators  
7. **Output format**: Production of multiple output files tailored to different analytical uses, including rapid outlier review, full data quality analysis, and inputs for downstream FASTR modules  

The module processes data in long format, with one record per facility–indicator–period combination, and outputs standardized data quality measures that are used by subsequent modules to inform data adjustment, weighting, or exclusion decisions.

## Detailed reference

This section provides technical details for implementers, developers, and analysts who need to understand the underlying methodology.

### Configuration parameters

The module uses several configurable parameters that control analysis behavior:

???+ "Geographic settings"

    ```r
    # Country identifier
    COUNTRY_ISO3 <- "GIN"  # ISO3 country code

    # Geographic level for consistency analysis
    GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_3"  # Admin level (1=national, 2=region, 3=district, etc.)
    ```

    The `GEOLEVEL` parameter determines the aggregation level for consistency analysis. Lower administrative levels (3-4) capture local patterns but may have sparse data. Higher levels (2) provide more stable estimates but may mask local inconsistencies.

??? "Outlier detection parameters"

    ```r
    # Proportion threshold for outlier detection
    OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.8  # Flag if single month > 80% of the trailing 12-month total

    # Minimum count to consider for outlier flagging
    MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 100  # Only flag outliers with count > 100

    # Number of Median Absolute Deviations for statistical outlier detection
    MADS <- 10  # Flag if value > 10 MADs from median
    ```

    **Tuning guidance:**
    - **More sensitive detection**: Lower `OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` to 0.6-0.7, reduce `MADS` to 8
    - **Less sensitive detection**: Increase `OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` to 0.9, increase `MADS` to 12-15
    - **Small facilities**: Lower `MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD` to 50
    - **Large facilities only**: Increase `MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD` to 200+

??? "DQA indicator selection"

    ```r
    # Core indicators used for DQA scoring (default)
    DQA_INDICATORS <- c("anc1", "penta1", "opd")

    # Consistency pairs to evaluate (default)
    CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED <- c("penta", "anc", "delivery")
    ```

    **`DQA_INDICATORS` accepted values** (from the platform parameter): any subset of `c("anc1", "penta1", "opd")`.

    **`CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED` accepted values** (from the platform parameter): any subset of `c("penta", "anc", "delivery", "malaria")`.

??? "Consistency benchmark ranges"

    ```r
    all_consistency_ranges <- list(
      pair_penta    = c(lower = 0.95, upper = Inf),  # Penta1 >= 0.95 * Penta3
      pair_anc      = c(lower = 0.95, upper = Inf),  # ANC1 >= 0.95 * ANC4
      pair_delivery = c(lower = 0.7, upper = 1.3),   # 0.7 <= BCG/Delivery <= 1.3
      pair_malaria  = c(lower = 0.9, upper = 1.1)    # Malaria indicators within 10%
    )
    ```

    The ranges reflect programmatic expectations. For example, ANC1 should always be at least 95% of ANC4 (more women start care than complete four visits). The 5% tolerance accounts for data entry variations. BCG, as a birth dose vaccine, should approximately equal facility deliveries, with 30% tolerance for variation.

    Remaining consistency pairs: pair_penta, pair_anc
    ```

??? "outlier_analysis()"

    **Signature**: `outlier_analysis(data, geo_cols, outlier_params)`

    **Purpose**: Identifies statistical outliers in facility service volumes using dual detection methods

    **Parameters:**

    - `data`: HMIS data with facility_id, indicator_common_id, period_id, count
    - `geo_cols`: Vector of geographic column names
    - `outlier_params`: List containing:
      - `outlier_pc_threshold`: Proportion threshold (default 0.8)
      - `count_threshold`: Minimum count threshold (default 100)

    **Returns**: Dataframe with outlier flags and diagnostic metrics for each facility-indicator-period

    **Calculated fields:**

    - `median_volume`: Median count by facility-indicator
    - `mad_volume`: MAD calculated on values >= median
    - `mad_residual`: Standardized residual (|count - median| / MAD)
    - `outlier_mad`: Binary flag (1 if mad_residual > MADS)
    - `pc`: Proportional contribution to the trailing 12-month total (rolling window ending at the row's period)
    - `outlier_pc`: Binary flag (1 if pc > threshold)
    - `outlier_flag`: Final flag (1 if either method flags AND count > minimum threshold)

    **Algorithm steps:**

    **Step 1**: Calculate median volume for each facility-indicator combination

    **Step 2**: Compute MAD using only values equal to or above the median
    - Avoids bias from facilities with many low-volume months
    - Standardizes residuals by dividing (count - median) by MAD
    - Flags outlier_mad = 1 if mad_residual > MADS parameter

    **Step 3**: Calculate proportional contribution
    - For each facility-indicator-period, sum the count over the trailing 12 months ending at that period (rolling window)
    - Calculate pc = count / window_total (pc is NA if the window total is 0)
    - Flags outlier_pc = 1 if pc > OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD
    - This rolling-window denominator replaces a calendar-year denominator, which falsely flagged facilities whose only reporting fell early in a calendar year (their single month was its own denominator)

    **Step 4**: Combine flags
    - Final outlier_flag = 1 if (outlier_mad = 1 OR outlier_pc = 1) AND count > MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD
    - The threshold (default 100) ensures only substantial volumes are flagged, avoiding false positives at low-volume facilities

    ```

    **Rationale**: Measuring consistency at the geographic level accounts for patient movement between facilities and provides a more accurate picture of service utilization patterns across a community.

??? "expand_geo_consistency_to_facilities()"

    **Signature**: `expand_geo_consistency_to_facilities(facility_metadata, geo_consistency_results, geo_level)`

    **Purpose**: Assigns geographic-level consistency results to individual facilities

    **Parameters:**

    - `facility_metadata`: Facility list with geographic assignments
    - `geo_consistency_results`: Output from geo_consistency_analysis()
    - `geo_level`: Geographic level used in consistency analysis

    **Returns**: Facility-level dataset with consistency flags

    **Process:**

    - Extracts facility list with their geographic assignments
    - Performs left join to replicate geo-level consistency scores to all facilities in that area
    - Uses many-to-many relationship to handle multiple periods and ratio types

    **Rationale**: Since consistency is measured at the geographic level (accounting for patient movement between facilities), all facilities within the same district/ward receive the same consistency scores.

??? "dqa_with_consistency()"

    **Signature**: `dqa_with_consistency(completeness_data, consistency_data, outlier_data, geo_cols, dqa_rules)`

    **Purpose**: Calculates comprehensive DQA scores including consistency checks when consistency pairs are available

    **Parameters:**

    - `completeness_data`: Output from process_completeness()
    - `consistency_data`: Wide-format facility consistency results
    - `outlier_data`: Output from outlier_analysis()
    - `geo_cols`: Vector of geographic column names
    - `dqa_rules`: List specifying required values for each dimension

    **DQA Rules Configuration:**

    ```r
    dqa_rules <- list(
      completeness = 1,   # Must be complete (flag = 1)
      outlier_flag = 0,   # Must NOT be an outlier (flag = 0)
      sconsistency = 1    # Must be consistent (flag = 1)
    )
    ```

    **Scoring algorithm:**

    **1. Completeness-Outlier Score** (per facility-period):
    - Each DQA indicator scores 0-2 points (1 for completeness + 1 for no outlier)
    - Maximum possible = 2 × number of DQA indicators
    - Score = Total Points / Maximum Points

    **2. Consistency Score** (per facility-period):
    - Only counts pairs where both indicators exist (NA pairs excluded from denominator)
    - Score = Number of passing pairs / Number of available pairs
    - If no pairs available, score = 0

    **3. Mean DQA Score:**
    - Average of completeness-outlier score and consistency score
    - Formula: `(completeness_outlier_score + consistency_score) / 2`

    **4. Binary DQA Score:**
    - 1 if all checks pass (complete, no outliers, consistent)
    - 0 if any check fails

    **Handling missing indicators:**
    The function intelligently handles cases where some consistency indicators are missing:
    - NA values in consistency pairs are NOT replaced with 0
    - Only available pairs contribute to the denominator
    - This prevents penalizing facilities for indicators they do not provide

    **Example calculation:**

    ```
    Facility X in period 202401:
    - DQA Indicators: penta1, anc1, opd (3 indicators)
    - Completeness: All 3 complete → 3 points
    - Outliers: None → 3 points
    - Total: 6/6 → completeness_outlier_score = 1.0

    Consistency Pairs:
    - pair_penta (penta1/penta3): Pass (1)
    - pair_anc (anc1/anc4): Fail (0)
    - pair_delivery: NA (bcg not a DQA indicator)

    Consistency calculation:
    - Available pairs: 2 (penta, anc)
    - Passing pairs: 1 (penta)
    - consistency_score = 1/2 = 0.5

    Final scores:
    - dqa_mean = (1.0 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.75
    - dqa_score = 0 (not all pairs passed)
    ```

??? "dqa_without_consistency()"

    **Signature**: `dqa_without_consistency(completeness_data, outlier_data, geo_cols, dqa_rules)`

    **Purpose**: Calculates DQA scores using only completeness and outlier checks when consistency data is unavailable or no valid consistency pairs exist

    **When used:**

    - No consistency pairs defined in configuration
    - All consistency pairs have missing indicators
    - Dataset does not contain paired indicators

    **Scoring:**

    - Uses only completeness and outlier components
    - `dqa_mean` = `completeness_outlier_score`
    - `dqa_score` = 1 if all completeness and outlier checks pass, 0 otherwise

    **Output structure:**

    ```r
    dqa_results <- data.frame(
      facility_id,
      admin_area_X,              # Dynamic geographic columns
      period_id,
      completeness_outlier_score, # Range: 0-1
      dqa_mean,                   # Range: 0-1 (equals completeness_outlier_score)
      dqa_score                   # Binary: 0 or 1
    )
    ```

### Statistical methods & algorithms

??? "Median absolute deviation (MAD) calculation"

    The MAD is a robust measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers than standard deviation.

    **Standard MAD Algorithm:**
    1. Compute the median of the dataset
    2. Calculate absolute deviations: |value - median| for each data point
    3. Find the median of these absolute deviations

    **FASTR Modification:**
    The module calculates MAD using only values at or above the median, making it more sensitive to high outliers while avoiding bias from facilities with many low-volume months.

    **Outlier degree calculation:**

    $$
    \text{MAD Residual} = \frac{|\text{volume} - \text{median volume}|}{\text{MAD}}
    $$

    **Outlier classification:**
    - If MAD Residual > 10 (configurable via `MADS` parameter), the value is flagged as a MAD-based outlier (`outlier_mad = 1`)
    - The final `outlier_flag` also requires count > 100

    **Example:**

    ```
    Facility ABC, Indicator: penta1
    Monthly counts: 20, 25, 22, 28, 24, 26, 150, 23, 27, 25, 21, 24

    Step 1: Calculate median = 24.5
    Step 2: Values >= median: 25, 28, 24.5, 26, 150, 27, 25, 24.5
    Step 3: Absolute deviations from median: 0.5, 3.5, 0, 1.5, 125.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0
    Step 4: MAD = median(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 125.5) = 1.0
    Step 5: For count=150: MAD residual = |150 - 24.5| / 1.0 = 125.5
    Step 6: 125.5 > 10 AND 150 > 100, therefore outlier_flag = 1
    ```

??? "Proportional outlier detection"

    This method identifies months where a single observation represents an unusually large proportion of the facility-indicator's reported volume over the preceding 12 months.

    **Algorithm:**
    1. For each facility-indicator-period, sum the count over the trailing 12 months ending at that period (rolling window per facility × indicator)
    2. Calculate the proportion: `pc = monthly_count / window_total` (set to NA if the window total is 0)
    3. Flag as proportional outlier (`outlier_pc = 1`) if `pc > OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` (default 0.8)
    4. The final `outlier_flag` also requires count > 100

    **Rationale:**
    A facility reporting 80% of its trailing-year volume in a single month likely indicates a data entry error (e.g., cumulative reporting instead of monthly, extra digit entered). The trailing 12-month window replaces an earlier calendar-year denominator: a facility whose only reporting fell early in a calendar year was previously its own denominator (pc ≈ 1.0) and was incorrectly flagged.

    **Example:**

    ```
    Facility XYZ, Indicator: anc1
    Monthly counts (Jun 2023 – May 2024):
      Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May
       15   18   12   16   14   17   13   16   15   14   12  890

    For May 2024 (count=890):
    window_total = 15+18+12+16+14+17+13+16+15+14+12+890 = 1052
    pc = 890 / 1052 = 0.846
    0.846 > 0.8 AND 890 > 100, therefore outlier_flag = 1
    ```

??? "Consistency ratio benchmarks"

    The module applies programmatically defined benchmarks for indicator pairs:

    **ANC Consistency:**

    $$
    \text{ANC Consistency} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \frac{\text{ANC1 Volume}}{\text{ANC4 Volume}} \geq 0.95 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    **Interpretation**: More women should start ANC (ANC1) than complete four visits (ANC4). The ratio is expected to be ≥ 0.95, allowing up to 5% tolerance for data variations.

    **Penta consistency:**

    $$
    \text{Penta Consistency} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \frac{\text{Penta1 Volume}}{\text{Penta3 Volume}} \geq 0.95 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    **Interpretation**: More children should receive Penta1 than complete the three-dose series (Penta3).

    **BCG/Delivery Consistency:**

    $$
    \text{BCG/Delivery Consistency} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & 0.7 \leq \frac{\text{BCG Volume}}{\text{Delivery Volume}} \leq 1.3 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    **Interpretation**: BCG is a birth dose vaccine, so BCG vaccinations should approximately equal facility deliveries. The wider range (±30%) accounts for infants born elsewhere receiving BCG at the facility or facility-born infants receiving BCG elsewhere.

    **Implementation detail:**
    Consistency is assessed at the district/ward level (specified by `GEOLEVEL`) to account for patients visiting multiple facilities within their local area for different services.

??? "Completeness calculation"

    For a given indicator in a given month:

    $$
    \text{Completeness} = \frac{\text{Number of reporting facilities}}{\text{Number of expected facilities}} \times 100
    $$

    **Expected facilities definition:**
    A facility is expected to report for an indicator if it has ever reported for that indicator within the analysis timeframe AND is not flagged as inactive.

    **Inactive facility definition:**
    A facility is flagged as inactive for periods where it did not report for six or more consecutive months before its first report or after its last report.

    **Example:**

    ```
    District has 20 facilities that have ever reported penta1 data in 2024
    In March 2024:
    - 18 facilities submitted penta1 data
    - 2 facilities did not submit (but are not inactive)

    Completeness = 18 / 20 × 100 = 90%
    ```

    **Important note**: A high level of completeness does not necessarily indicate that the HMIS is representative of all service delivery in the country, as some services may not be delivered in facilities or some facilities may not report. For countries where DHIS2 does not store zeros, indicator completeness may be underestimated if there are many low-volume facilities.

??? "DQA composite score calculation"

    The DQA score combines three quality dimensions for a defined set of core indicators.

    **Component scores:**

    **1. Completeness-Outlier Score:**

    $$
    \text{Completeness-Outlier Score} = \frac{\sum (\text{completeness pass} + \text{outlier pass})}{2 \times \text{number of DQA indicators}}
    $$

    **2. Consistency Score:**

    $$
    \text{Consistency Score} = \frac{\text{Number of pairs passing benchmarks}}{\text{Number of available pairs}}
    $$

    **3. Mean DQA Score:**

    $$
    \text{DQA Mean} = \frac{\text{Completeness-Outlier Score} + \text{Consistency Score}}{2}
    $$

    **4. Binary DQA Score:**

    $$
    \text{DQA Score} =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if all checks pass (complete, no outliers, consistent)} \\
    0, & \text{if any check fails}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    **Passing criteria for binary score:**
    - ALL DQA indicators must be complete (completeness_flag = 1)
    - ALL DQA indicators must be free of outliers (outlier_flag = 0)
    - ALL available consistency pairs must pass benchmarks (sconsistency = 1)

    **Example calculation:**

    ```
    Facility 123, Period 202403
    DQA Indicators: penta1, anc1, opd

    Completeness: penta1=1, anc1=1, opd=1 → 3 points
    Outliers: penta1=0, anc1=0, opd=0 → 3 points
    Completeness-Outlier Score = 6 / (2×3) = 1.0

    Consistency Pairs:
    - pair_penta: 1 (pass)
    - pair_anc: 1 (pass)
    Consistency Score = 2 / 2 = 1.0

    DQA Mean = (1.0 + 1.0) / 2 = 1.0
    DQA Score = 1 (all checks passed)
    ```

### Code examples

??? "Example 1: Running the module with default settings"

    ```r
    # Set working directory
    setwd("/path/to/module/directory")

    # Load required libraries
    library(zoo)
    library(stringr)
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    library(data.table)

    # The module will automatically:
    # 1. Load hmis_ISO3.csv
    # 2. Run all analyses with default parameters
    # 3. Generate output CSV files in the working directory

    source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
    ```

??? "Example 2: Adjusting outlier detection sensitivity"

    ```r
    # Make outlier detection more sensitive (lower thresholds)
    OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.6   # Flag if >60% of trailing 12-month volume (was 80%)
    MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 50         # Consider counts >=50 (was 100)
    MADS <- 8                             # Flag at 8 MADs (was 10)

    # Run the module
    source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
    ```

    **Use case**: Countries with generally low service volumes where the default thresholds are too conservative.

??? "Example 3: Different geographic level for consistency"

    ```r
    # Use district level (admin_area_2) instead of sub-district (admin_area_3)
    GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_2"

    # This affects consistency analysis aggregation level
    source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
    ```

    **Use case**: Sub-district level has sparse data or too few facilities per area, making district-level aggregation more stable.

??? "Example 4: custom DQA indicators"

    ```r
    # Focus DQA on maternal health indicators only
    DQA_INDICATORS <- c("anc1", "anc4", "delivery", "pnc1")

    # Only evaluate anc consistency pair
    CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED <- c("anc")

    source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
    ```

    **Use case**: Specialized analysis focusing on a specific service area.

??? "Example 5: Running for different country"

    ```r
    # Configure for your country
    COUNTRY_ISO3 <- "ISO3"  # Replace with your country code
    PROJECT_DATA_HMIS <- "hmis_ISO3.csv"
    GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_3"

    # Adjust for country-specific indicators if needed
    DQA_INDICATORS <- c("penta1", "anc1", "opd", "fp_new")

    source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
    ```

??? "Example 6: Programmatic use of outputs"

    ```r
    # After running the module, work with outputs

    # Load DQA results
    dqa_results <- read.csv("M1_output_dqa.csv")

    # Filter to high-quality facility-months only
    high_quality <- dqa_results %>%
      filter(dqa_score == 1)

    # Calculate percentage of facility-months passing DQA by district
    quality_by_district <- dqa_results %>%
      group_by(admin_area_2, period_id) %>%
      summarize(
        total_facility_months = n(),
        passing_quality = sum(dqa_score == 1),
        pct_passing = 100 * passing_quality / total_facility_months
      )

    # Identify facilities with consistently poor quality (never passing)
    poor_quality_facilities <- dqa_results %>%
      group_by(facility_id) %>%
      summarize(
        months_analyzed = n(),
        months_passed = sum(dqa_score == 1),
        pct_passed = 100 * months_passed / months_analyzed
      ) %>%
      filter(pct_passed == 0)
    ```

### Troubleshooting

??? "Problem: Module skips consistency analysis"

    **Symptoms:**
    - Console message: "No valid consistency pairs found"
    - M1_output_consistency_geo.csv has only headers
    - DQA scores calculated without consistency component

    **Diagnosis:**
    Check that both indicators in each pair exist in your dataset:

    ```r
    # Load your data
    data <- read.csv("hmis_[COUNTRY].csv")

    # Check available indicators
    print(unique(data$indicator_common_id))

    # Compare with required pairs
    # For pair_penta: need "penta1" and "penta3"
    # For pair_anc: need "anc1" and "anc4"
    # For pair_delivery: need "bcg" and "delivery" (or "sba")
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    1. Adjust `CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED` to only include pairs with available indicators
    2. Modify indicator names in your data to match expected names
    3. Accept that DQA will be calculated without consistency component

??? "Problem: All facilities flagged as outliers"

    **Symptoms:**
    - Very high percentage of outlier_flag = 1 in M1_output_outliers.csv
    - Most observations in outlier_list.csv

    **Diagnosis:**
    Your thresholds may be too sensitive for your data context.

    **Solutions:**

    1. Increase MAD threshold:

    ```r
    MADS <- 15  # Increase from default 10
    ```

    2. Increase proportion threshold:

    ```r
    OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.9  # Increase from 0.8
    ```

    3. Increase minimum count threshold (focus on larger facilities):

    ```r
    MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 200  # Increase from 100
    ```

    4. Review the data: Check if there are genuine quality issues requiring data cleaning rather than parameter adjustment

??? "Problem: no DQA results generated"

    **Symptoms:**
    - M1_output_dqa.csv is empty or has only headers
    - Console message: "Skipping DQA analysis - none of the required indicators found"

    **Diagnosis:**
    None of the indicators specified in `DQA_INDICATORS` exist in your dataset.

    **Solution:**
    Check which DQA indicators are missing:

    ```r
    # Load data
    data <- read.csv("hmis_[COUNTRY].csv")

    # Check which DQA indicators are missing
    available_indicators <- unique(data$indicator_common_id)
    missing_indicators <- setdiff(DQA_INDICATORS, available_indicators)
    print(paste("Missing DQA indicators:", paste(missing_indicators, collapse=", ")))

    # Available DQA indicators
    available_dqa <- intersect(DQA_INDICATORS, available_indicators)
    print(paste("Available DQA indicators:", paste(available_dqa, collapse=", ")))
    ```

    Then update `DQA_INDICATORS` to include only available indicators:

    ```r
    DQA_INDICATORS <- c("penta1", "anc1")  # Only use what's available
    ```

??? "Problem: Consistency ratios seem incorrect"

    **Symptoms:**
    - All consistency flags are 0 (inconsistent)
    - Consistency ratios are unexpectedly high or low

    **Diagnosis:**
    The geographic aggregation level may be inappropriate for your data.

    **Investigation:**

    ```r
    # Load geographic consistency results
    geo_cons <- read.csv("M1_output_consistency_geo.csv")

    # Check distribution of consistency ratios
    summary(geo_cons$consistency_ratio)

    # Check sample sizes at geographic level
    outliers <- read.csv("M1_output_outliers.csv")
    geo_summary <- outliers %>%
      group_by(admin_area_3, period_id) %>%
      summarize(
        n_facilities = n_distinct(facility_id),
        total_volume = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)
      )
    summary(geo_summary$n_facilities)
    ```

    **Solutions:**

    1. If geographic areas have very few facilities (1-2), use higher level:

    ```r
    GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_2"  # Use district instead of sub-district
    ```

    2. If ratios are generally below 0.95 for ANC/Penta pairs, this may indicate genuine programmatic issues (high dropout) rather than data quality problems

    3. Review the consistency benchmark ranges - they may need adjustment for your context:

    ```r
    # Example: Allow higher dropout (lower ratio) for Penta
    all_consistency_ranges$pair_penta <- c(lower = 0.85, upper = Inf)
    ```

??? "Problem: Completeness percentages seem low"

    **Symptoms:**
    - High proportion of completeness_flag = 0 in M1_output_completeness.csv

    **Diagnosis:**
    This could be legitimate (poor reporting) or an artifact of how your DHIS2 stores zero values.

    **Investigation:**

    ```r
    # Load completeness data
    completeness <- read.csv("M1_output_completeness.csv")

    # Check pattern: Are there explicit zeros or just missing values?
    outliers <- read.csv("M1_output_outliers.csv")
    table(is.na(outliers$count), outliers$count == 0)

    # Check completeness by indicator
    comp_by_indicator <- completeness %>%
      group_by(indicator_common_id) %>%
      summarize(
        pct_complete = 100 * mean(completeness_flag == 1),
        pct_incomplete = 100 * mean(completeness_flag == 0)
      )
    print(comp_by_indicator)
    ```

    **Considerations:**
    1. If your DHIS2 does not store zeros, low-volume facilities may appear incomplete when they legitimately had no services to report
    2. Completeness percentages should be interpreted in context - 70% completeness may be acceptable depending on the health system
    3. Use the completeness_flag in subsequent modules to weight estimates appropriately

??? "Problem: Error reading input file"

    **Symptoms:**
    - Error: "Cannot open file 'hmis_[COUNTRY].csv'"
    - Module crashes during data loading

    **Solutions:**

    1. Check file path and working directory:

    ```r
    getwd()  # Verify working directory
    list.files()  # Check if HMIS file is present
    ```

    2. Verify file name matches `PROJECT_DATA_HMIS` parameter

    3. Check file format (CSV, proper encoding, comma-separated)

    4. Ensure required columns exist:

    ```r
    # After loading
    names(data)  # Should include: facility_id, period_id, indicator_common_id, count
    ```

### Usage notes

??? "Interpretation guidelines"

    **Outlier flags:**
    - outlier_flag = 1 suggests potential data quality issues, but require investigation
    - Not all flagged outliers are errors (genuine service campaigns can trigger flags)
    - Use mad_residual and pc values to prioritize review

    **Completeness:**
    - Completeness % varies by health system context
    - 80-90%+ is generally good, but depends on country
    - Trend over time more informative than absolute percentage
    - Low completeness for specific indicators may reflect genuine service gaps

    **Consistency:**
    - sconsistency = 0 may indicate data quality issues OR programmatic performance issues (e.g., high dropout)
    - Requires programmatic knowledge to interpret
    - Geographic patterns can help distinguish systematic issues from random errors

    **DQA Scores:**
    - dqa_score = 1 indicates data passed all checks, suitable for unadjusted use
    - dqa_score = 0 requires further investigation
    - dqa_mean provides nuanced view (0.75 = mostly good, 0.25 = mostly poor)

??? "Choosing which outputs to review"

    **For initial assessment**:

    - Start with DQA summary heatmaps to identify areas/indicators with issues
    - Focus on high-volume indicators (ANC1, Penta1, Delivery) which are more reliable
    - Review completeness trends over time before point estimates

    **For deeper investigation**:

    - Use outlier detail files to see specific flagged values
    - Cross-reference consistency issues with programmatic knowledge
    - Compare patterns across adjacent geographic areas

    **Priority order**:

    1. Completeness - affects whether data represents the full picture
    2. Outliers - directly distort aggregate statistics
    3. Consistency - may indicate systemic issues or data entry problems

??? "Limitations"

    **Statistical limitations**:

    - MAD-based outlier detection assumes roughly symmetric distributions
    - Consistency thresholds (98th percentile) may need context-specific tuning
    - Completeness assessment requires accurate facility master list

    **Interpretation caveats**:

    - Not all flagged issues are errors (campaigns, outbreaks cause genuine spikes)
    - Consistency failures may reflect programmatic issues, not data quality
    - Geographic aggregations can mask facility-level variation

    **Data requirements**:

    - At least 6 months of data recommended for stable outlier detection
    - Facility identifiers must be consistent across periods
    - Missing geographic identifiers limit subnational analysis

## How FASTR analyzes your data

FASTR runs **4 modules in order**. Each one sets the stage for the next:

| | Module | What it does | Why |
|---|--------|-------------|-----|
| 1️⃣ | **Check quality** | Spots data entry errors, missing reports, and inconsistencies | You can't analyze unreliable data |
| 2️⃣ | **Fix problems** | Replaces extreme values and fills in missing months | Clean data for reliable results |
| 3️⃣ | **Analyze services** | Compares observed volumes to what was expected to detect disruptions | Know where and when services changed |
| 4️⃣ | **Estimate coverage** | Calculates % of population covered from reported data | Move from raw numbers to indicators that guide action |

You will run all 4 modules on the platform during this workshop.
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_1 -->
## FASTR takes a multi-pronged approach to data quality, with the belief that data quality should not be a barrier to data use – with the right feedback loops, use of data can contribute to improved quality

- We do granular data quality assessments and adjustments based on facility-level data leveraging HMIS access with an API

- We use only high-volume indicators, because the most-used services provide more stable estimates

- We focus on variations across time and space rather than specific point estimates and discuss the interpretation and relevance for decision-making with in-country decision-makers

- We believe that using the data and providing feedback is the first step to improving the data

We will discuss each of these areas over the next sessions.
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_1b -->
## Rationale for data quality assessment

**Challenge:** Routine health facility data may contain quality limitations:
- Reported values may fall outside plausible ranges
- Reporting gaps affect data completeness
- Inconsistencies exist between related indicators

&nbsp;

**Implications:** Data quality limitations affect decision-making
- Inaccurate assessments of service delivery trends
- Misidentification of areas requiring intervention
- Suboptimal resource allocation
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_1c -->
## Assessing and adjusting for data quality

Quality assessments identify the highest priority issues and necessary analytical adjustments, so quality issues do not become a barrier to data analysis and use.

&nbsp;

**Objective 1: Enable analytical adjustment**

Systematic data quality assessment supports the application of targeted adjustments, enhancing the utility of HMIS data for evidence-based decision-making.

&nbsp;

**Objective 2: Monitor data quality trends**

Data quality assessment enables ongoing monitoring to:
- Inform indicator selection based on quality profiles across the HMIS
- Guide targeted data quality interventions and supportive supervision in areas with weaker data quality
- Evaluate the effectiveness of data quality improvement initiatives over time

## Measures of data quality - detailed

| Data quality domain | What does it measure? | How is it assessed? |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Completeness** | Are all data present? Is there sufficient information available to make decisions about the health of the population and to target resources to improve health-system coverage, efficiency and quality? | • Assessed by measuring whether all units that are supposed to report actually do (reporting completeness)<br>• Assessed by measuring the completeness of indicator data (no missing values); this is different from overall reporting completeness in that it looks at completeness of specific data elements and not only at the receipt of the monthly reporting form (indicator completeness) |
| **Timeliness** | Are data regularly submitted on time? | • Assessed by measuring whether the units that submitted reports did so before a set deadline (timeliness) |
| **Consistency** | Are data plausible in view of what has been previously reported? | • Trends are evaluated to determine whether reported values are extreme relative to other values reported during the year or across several years (presence of outliers)<br>• Assess trends in program indicators to determine whether reported values are extreme in relation to other values that are reported during the year or over several years (consistency over time)<br>• Assess program indicators which have a predictable relationship to determine whether the expected relationship exists between those 2 indicators (consistency between related indicators)<br>• Assess the level of agreement between two sources of data measuring the same health indicator (external comparison with other data sources)<br>• Determine the adequacy of the population data used in evaluating the performance of health indicators (consistency of population data) |
| **Accuracy** | Do data faithfully reflect the actual level of service delivery conducted in the health facility? | • Assess the accuracy for selected indicators through the review of source documents in health facilities and comparison to monthly reports and HMIS values (data verification factor) |

## How does the FASTR data quality analysis differ from the DQA analysis done in DHIS2?

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

**Purpose of data quality assessment**

- **DHIS2:** focuses on data quality assessment to routinely strengthen data quality over time
- **FASTR:** focuses on assessing data quality to inform an analysis which answers a pressing policy question

**Data quality adjustment**

- **DHIS2:** focus is on identifying data quality issues and working with facilities to improve reporting practices
- **FASTR:** focus on applying analytical adjustment techniques to account for data quality issues in the analysis; goal is to generate the most robust estimates despite data quality challenges

**Selection of indicators, measures, and thresholds** – FASTR focuses on DQA elements most relevant for analysis

- The purpose of the data quality assessment guides the selection of indicators, measures, and thresholds
- DHIS2 allows configuration of a DQA dashboard for any selection of indicators in DHIS2; FASTR selects indicators that will be used in a specific analysis
- DHIS2 DQA includes timeliness as a measure of data quality. FASTR does not include timeliness. Timeliness is an important consideration for strengthening routine reporting but it less important to do an analysis with the data we have available today
- DHIS2 DQA includes reporting completeness (e.g. was a report submitted) and indicator completeness (e.g. was a value recorded for an individual data element) while FASTR focuses only on indicator completeness

</div>
<!-- /SLIDE -->

## How does the FASTR data quality analysis differ from the DQA analysis done in DHIS2?

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

**Selection of indicators, measures, and thresholds continued**

The purpose of the data quality assessment guides the selection of indicators, measures, and thresholds.

- DHIS2 DQA assesses four measures of internal consistency: presence of outliers, consistency over time, consistency between related indicators, and consistency between reported data and original records (this metric requires a site assessment / data collection). FASTR focuses on two of these measures: presence of outliers and consistency between related indicators because these are important for analysis and can be done routinely and remotely without visits to heath facilities.

- FASTR and DHIS2 DQA use different outlier detection methods (MADs vs standard deviations); FASTR focuses on identifying VERY large outliers that have undue influence in the analysis and for which adjustments will be made; DHIS2 DQA focuses on identifying outliers that should be followed up at the facility level, with no significant negative impact even if a few correct values are flagged as potential outliers, since these will be investigated further.

- DHIS2 DQA may assess agreement with external data sources such as periodic population-based surveys and consistency of population data which serves as the denominator for coverage analysis. FASTR does not include this in the data quality assessment but instead incorporates this in our coverage analysis.

</div>
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_2 -->
## Indicator completeness

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

**What it measures:** The extent to which facilities report data on selected core indicators

**Why it matters:**
- Higher completeness improves data reliability
- Stability over time strengthens trend analysis

**Key distinction:** Indicator completeness ≠ reporting completeness. This metric examines specific data elements, not just whether the monthly form was submitted.

**For the FASTR analysis, completeness is defined as:** The percentage of reporting facilities each month out of the total number of facilities expected to report.
- A facility is deemed to be "reporting" if there is a non-missing value recorded for the indicator and month
- A facility is expected to report if it has reported any volume for that indicator anytime within a year
- Facilities that do not report for six or more consecutive months at the beginning or end of their reporting period are classified as **inactive** rather than incomplete. This prevents penalizing facilities that have not yet begun reporting or have permanently ceased operations

</div>

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- Indicator completeness measures the extent to which facilities that are supposed to report data on the selected core indicators are in fact doing so
- Higher completeness improves reliability of the data, especially when completeness is stable over time
- This is different from overall reporting completeness in that it looks at completeness of specific data elements and not only at the receipt of the monthly reporting form
- For the FASTR analysis, completeness is defined as: The percentage of reporting facilities each month out of the total number of facilities expected to report
- A facility is deemed to be "reporting" if there is a non-missing value recorded for the indicator and month
- A facility is expected to report if it has reported any volume for each indicator anytime within a year
-->
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_2a -->
## Notes on completeness

- A high level of completeness does not necessarily indicate that the HMIS is representative of all service delivery in the country as some services may not be delivered in facilities, or some facilities may not report

- For countries where the DHIS2 system does not store 0's, indicator completeness may be underestimated if there are many low-volume facilities for a given indicator
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_3 -->
## Outliers

The presence of outliers examines whether a data point in a series of values is extreme (either abnormally high or low) in relation to others in the series.

Outliers can be the result of changes in programmatic activities (such as an intensified campaign) or can be data quality problems.

For the FASTR analysis, we identify outliers which are suspiciously high values compared to the usual volume of services reported by the facility (e.g., low values are not identified as outliers in the FASTR analysis).

- Outliers are identified by assessing the within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator
- An outlier is defined as: A value greater than 10 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the monthly median value for the indicator in each time period, OR a value for which the proportional contribution in volume for a facility, indicator, and time period is greater than 80%
- AND for which: The volume is greater than or equal to the median, the volume is not missing, and the volume is greater than 100

<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_3c -->
## Outlier detection methodology

Outliers are identified by assessing the within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator.

An outlier is defined as:

A value greater than **10 times the median absolute deviation (MAD)** from the monthly median value for the indicator in each time period, **OR** a value for which the proportional contribution in volume for a facility, indicator, and time period is **greater than 80%**

**AND** for which:

- The volume is **greater than or equal to the median**
- The volume is **not missing**
- The volume is **greater than 100**

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- For the FASTR analysis, the time period considered for identifying outliers using the MAD approach spans the entire dataset. This means that if the dataset includes five years of data, the median value for each indicator will be calculated across the entire five-year period
- For the FASTR analysis, the proportional allocation approach to identifying outliers is applied on a calendar-year basis. This means that all data from the year 2024 will be used to assess the proportional contribution of service volumes reported in 2024. If the analysis is conducted mid-year, only the available data up to that point will be considered, potentially leading to a partial year's data being used in the assessment
- This restricts the FASTR analysis to outliers which are suspiciously high values compared to the usual volume of services reported by a facility
- Missing data from a DHIS2 system can be due to non-reporting or reporting of zero services delivered (zeros are often not stored in DHIS2). We cannot distinguish between missing due to non-reporting and missing due to reporting zero services. As such, missing values are excluded from the analysis
- We restrict outlier detection to service volumes greater than 100 as this helps in focusing on meaningful, stable, and operationally significant data. It reduces noise due to small volume volatility and focuses on more impactful outliers (e.g. large volumes are likely to have more significant implications of the analysis)
-->
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_3a -->
## Investigating a flagged outlier

When FASTR flags a value as an outlier, ask these five questions before deciding what to do:

| # | Question | What to look for |
|---|----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Data entry error?** | Typo, extra zero, value in wrong field |
| 2 | **Reporting issue?** | Missing reports from other facilities changing the total |
| 3 | **Real event?** | Campaign, outbreak, new facility opened |
| 4 | **Definition change?** | Indicator was redefined or aggregation changed |
| 5 | **Should we exclude it?** | Does it distort the overall picture? |
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_3ab -->
## Making the call

Based on your investigation:

- **Severe problem** (clear data entry error, implausible value) — Exclude from analysis
- **Moderate concern** (plausible but uncertain) — Include with a note explaining the caveat
- **Minor or explainable** (campaign, real event) — Include — it reflects reality

**Try it:** Find one outlier flagged in your data. Walk through the 5 questions. What is your conclusion — exclude, include with caveat, or include?

## Consistency between related indicators

Program indicators with a predictable relationship are examined to determine whether the expected relationship exists between them. In other words, this process examines whether the observed relationship between the indicators, as shown in the reported data, is that which is expected.

<div class="columns">
<div>

| Indicator pair | Expected relationship |
|----------------|----------------------|
| ANC1 / ANC4 | Ratio should be ≥ 0.95 |
| Penta1 / Penta3 | Ratio should be ≥ 0.95 |
| BCG / Facility delivery | Within 30% (≥0.7 and ≤1.3) |

We expect the number of pregnant women receiving a first ANC visit will always be higher than the number of pregnant women receiving a fourth ANC visit.

BCG is a birth dose vaccine so we expect that these indicators will be equal. However, we recognize there may be more variability in this predicted relationship thus we set a range of within 30%.

</div>
<div>

![Consistency illustration h:280](/methodology/resources/diagrams/consistency_illustration.svg)

</div>
</div>

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- Consistency checks logical relationships: ANC1 should always ≥ ANC4 (can't have 4th visit without 1st)
- We assess at DISTRICT level because patients move between facilities within a district
- Example: woman has ANC1 at health post, ANC4 at district hospital - still consistent at district level
- BCG vs deliveries allows 30% tolerance because not all births happen in facilities
- Ask: In your context, do patients commonly seek different services at different facilities?
-->
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_4b -->
<!-- _class: two-panel -->

## Why assess consistency at district level?

<div class="panel-layout">
<div>

Patients often access different services at different facilities within a district:

- A woman may attend **ANC1** at a nearby health post, but travel to a health centre for **ANC4**
- A child may receive **Penta1** at a local clinic, but complete **Penta3** at a district hospital

Checking consistency at the facility level would miss these patterns. Aggregating to district level captures the complete picture of service utilization within a geographic area.

## Data quality summary score

A composite measure of data quality provides an overall view of how well a dataset meets quality standards.

By integrating multiple dimensions of data quality into a single score, it simplifies the interpretation of detailed information from several measures. This allows health systems to quickly assess the reliability of data, making it easier to identify trends and issues at a glance.

**Definition of adequate data quality:**

- No missing indicator data for OPD, Penta1, and ANC1, where available
- No outliers for OPD, Penta1, and ANC1, where available
- Consistent reporting between Penta1/Penta3 and ANC1/ANC4
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_5b -->
## Quick interpretation guide

| Score range | What it means | What to do |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Above 80%** | Reliable — use confidently for analysis | Proceed with analysis |
| **60-80%** | Usable with caution — some quality gaps | Note limitations, investigate weak dimensions |
| **Below 60%** | Investigate before using | Identify which dimension (completeness, outliers, consistency) is pulling the score down |

**Try it:** Check your region's overall DQA score. Is it above or below 80%? If below, look at the individual dimension scores — which one needs the most attention?
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_6 -->
## DQA module: Configuration parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Proportion threshold for outlier detection** | Adjusts the threshold for proportional contribution to flag a facility-month as an outlier |
| **Minimum count threshold for consideration** | Defines the minimum count required for a facility-month to be considered an outlier |
| **Number of MADs** | Outliers are defined as observations which are greater than X times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the monthly median value for the indicator in each time period |
| **Indicators subjected to DQA** | Defines which indicators are included for assessment of outliers and completeness for inclusion in the DQA score |
| **Consistency pairs used** | Defines which indicator pairs are used for consistency analysis and the expected ratio ranges |

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- These parameters can be adjusted in the platform settings
- Default values work well for most contexts but can be customized
- MAD multiplier of 10 is conservative - only flags extreme outliers
- Minimum count of 100 prevents low-volume facilities from being over-flagged
- Consistency pairs can be modified based on which indicators you're analyzing

## Data quality: what does FASTR check?

Before analyzing, FASTR checks if the data is reliable — like an accountant verifying the numbers before preparing a report.

**Three checks:**

- **Extreme values** — A facility suddenly reports 10× more than usual? Probably a data entry error
- **Missing reports** — A facility didn't submit a report for 3 months? Its data is missing
- **Logical consistency** — More 4th antenatal visits than 1st visits? Something is wrong

Each check produces a **quality score** that helps decide if data can be used as-is or needs adjustment.
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_s1 -->
## FASTR analytical pipeline

The FASTR analysis follows a sequential workflow:

1. **Assess data quality** - Identify issues with completeness, outliers, and consistency
2. **Adjust for quality issues** - Apply corrections to improve data reliability
3. **Analyze adjusted data** - Generate service utilization and coverage estimates

<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_s1b -->
## FASTR approach to data quality

FASTR takes a multi-pronged approach, based on the belief that **data quality should not be a barrier to data use**.

- Conduct granular, facility-level data quality assessments
- Focus on high-volume indicators that produce more stable estimates
- Emphasize variation over time and space rather than point estimates
- Interpret results collaboratively with in-country decision-makers

**Using data and providing feedback is viewed as the first step toward improving data quality.**
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_s2 -->
## Rationale for data quality assessment

**Challenge:** Routine health facility data may contain quality limitations:
- Reported values outside plausible ranges
- Reporting gaps affecting completeness
- Inconsistencies between related indicators

**Implications:** These limitations can distort decision-making:
- Inaccurate assessment of service delivery trends
- Misidentification of areas needing intervention
- Suboptimal resource allocation
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_s2b -->
## Objectives of data quality assessment

**Objective 1: Enable analytical adjustment**
Systematic assessment supports targeted adjustments, enhancing the utility of HMIS data for evidence-based decision-making.

**Objective 2: Monitor data quality trends**
- Inform indicator selection based on quality profiles
- Guide targeted interventions and supportive supervision
- Evaluate effectiveness of improvement initiatives over time
<!-- /SLIDE -->

<!-- SLIDE:m4_s3 -->
## Indicator completeness

Indicator completeness measures whether facilities that should be reporting data on specific indicators are actually doing so. This is different from overall reporting completeness - we're looking at specific data elements, not just whether the monthly form was submitted.

**Definition:** Percentage of facilities reporting each month out of facilities expected to report.
- A facility is "reporting" if there is a non-missing value for the indicator that month
- A facility is "expected to report" if it has reported any volume for that indicator within the past year

Higher and stable completeness improves data reliability.

<div style="background: #E8F4F3; border-left: 4px solid #1A8A8A; padding: 0.5em 1em; font-size: 0.75em; margin-top: 0.5em;">

**Notes on completeness:**

- A high level of completeness does not necessarily indicate that the HMIS is representative of all service delivery in the country as some services many not be delivered in facilities, or some facilities may not report.
- For countries where the DHIS2 system does not store 0's, indicator completeness may be underestimated if there are many low-volume facilities for a given indicator.

## Outlier detection

Outliers are values that are suspiciously **high** compared to a facility's usual reporting volume. They may result from data entry errors or genuine programmatic changes (e.g., campaigns).

**Note:** FASTR only flags high values as outliers - unusually low values are not flagged, as these more likely reflect service disruptions than data errors.

**How outliers are identified:** For each facility and indicator, we assess within-facility variation in monthly reporting. A value is flagged if it deviates significantly from the facility's typical pattern (using statistical thresholds based on median absolute deviation).

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- The presence of outliers examines whether a data point in a series of values is extreme (either abnormally high or low) in relation to others in the series
- Outliers can be the result of changes in programmatic activities (such as an intensified campaign) or can be data quality problems
- For the FASTR analysis, we identify outliers which are suspiciously high values compared to the usual volume of services reported by the facility (e.g., low values are not identified as outliers in the FASTR analysis)
- Outliers are identified by assessing the within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator
- An outlier is defined as: A value greater than 10 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the monthly median value for the indicator in each time period, OR a value for which the proportional contribution in volume for a facility, indicator, and time period is greater than 80%
- AND for which: The volume is greater than or equal to the median, the volume is not missing, and the volume is greater than 100
- For the FASTR analysis, the time period considered for identifying outliers using the MAD approach spans the entire dataset. This means that if the dataset includes five years of data, the median value for each indicator will be calculated across the entire five-year period
- For the FASTR analysis, the proportional allocation approach to identifying outliers is applied on a calendar-year basis. This means that all data from the year 2024 will be used to assess the proportional contribution of service volumes reported in 2024. If the analysis is conducted mid-year, only the available data up to that point will be considered, potentially leading to a partial year's data being used in the assessment
- This restricts the FASTR analysis to outliers which are suspiciously high values compared to the usual volume of services reported by a facility
- Missing data from a DHIS2 system can be due to non-reporting or reporting of zero services delivered (zeros are often not stored in DHIS2). We cannot distinguish between missing due to non-reporting and missing due to reporting zero services. As such, missing values are excluded from the analysis
- We restrict outlier detection to service volumes greater than 100 as this helps in focusing on meaningful, stable, and operationally significant data. It reduces noise due to small volume volatility and focuses on more impactful outliers (e.g. large volumes are likely to have more significant implications of the analysis)

- Missing data from a DHIS2 system can be due to non-reporting or reporting of zero services delivered (zeros are often not stored in DHIS2). We cannot distinguish between missing due to non-reporting and missing due to reporting zero services. As such, missing values are excluded from the analysis
- We restrict outlier detection to service volumes greater than 100 as this helps in focusing on meaningful, stable, and operationally significant data. It reduces noise due to small volume volatility and focuses on more impactful outliers (e.g. large volumes are likely to have more significant implications of the analysis)

## Internal consistency

<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">

Internal consistency checks whether related indicators maintain expected logical relationships. FASTR assesses the following pairs of indicators to measure internal consistency:

| Indicator pair | Expected relationship |
|----------------|----------------------|
| ANC1/ANC4 | Ratio should be greater than 1 |
| Penta1/Penta3 | Ratio should be greater than 1 |
| BCG/Facility delivery | Ratio should be within 30% (i.e. >=0.7 and <=1.3) |

We expect the number of pregnant women receiving a first ANC visit will always be higher than the number of pregnant women receiving a fourth ANC visit.

BCG is a birth dose vaccine so we expect that BCG and facility delivery will be equal. However, we recognize there may be more variability in this predicted relationship thus we set a range of within 30%.

FASTR assesses consistency at the **district level** rather than facility level. This is because patients frequently seek care from different facilities within the same district - a woman may have her ANC1 visit at a health post but travel to the district hospital for ANC4. Assessing at district level accounts for this patient movement.

**What you see:** Heatmap showing the % of districts where indicator pairs meet expected relationships (e.g., ANC1 ≥ ANC4).

**Formula:** Consistency % = (districts meeting criteria / total districts) × 100

**Interpretation:** Low consistency may indicate data flow problems, double-counting, or systematic under-reporting at the district level.

## Data quality summary score

A composite measure of data quality provides an overall view of how well a dataset meets quality standards.

By integrating multiple dimensions of data quality into a single score, it simplifies the interpretation of detailed information from several measures. This allows health systems to quickly assess the reliability of data, making it easier to identify trends and issues at a glance.

**Definition of adequate data quality:**

- No missing indicator data for OPD, Penta1, and ANC1, where available
- No outliers for OPD, Penta1, and ANC1, where available
- Consistent reporting between Penta1/Penta3 and ANC1/ANC4

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
- DQA score combines all dimensions into one summary score
- 100% = complete + no outliers + consistent - the goal for quality data
- Use the heatmap to identify priority areas for data quality improvement
- This completes the DQA module - next we'll look at how to adjust for these issues

**What you see:** Heatmap showing the percentage of facility-months that pass **all** quality checks, by indicator and region.

**Score:** Binary — each facility-month is either adequate (passes all checks) or not. The percentage reflects the share that pass.

**Interpretation:** A strict measure. Low scores indicate many facility-months fail at least one check. Use this to identify regions and indicators needing data quality improvement.

**What you see:** Heatmap showing the average DQA score across facility-months, by indicator and region.

**Score:** Average of the completeness-outlier score and the consistency score. Ranges from 0% to 100%.

**Interpretation:** A more nuanced measure than the overall score. Captures partial progress — a region can score 75% even if not all checks pass. Use this to track improvement over time.
