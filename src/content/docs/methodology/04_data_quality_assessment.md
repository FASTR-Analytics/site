## Background and purpose

### Objective of the module

The Data Quality Assessment (DQA) module evaluates the reliability of routine Health Management Information System (HMIS) data reported by health facilities. It functions as an initial quality control step within the FASTR pipeline, reviewing monthly facility reports to identify data quality issues prior to their use in downstream analysis.

The module assesses data quality across three complementary dimensions: outliers, which identify unusually high reported values that may reflect reporting or data entry errors; completeness, which measures the regularity and continuity of facility reporting over time; and consistency, which evaluates whether related indicators exhibit expected relationships. These dimensions are combined into an overall DQA score, providing a standardized summary measure of data reliability.

Routine HMIS data are a primary source for monitoring health service delivery at both facility and population levels, capturing events such as immunizations delivered and births attended by skilled health personnel. As with all routinely collected data, HMIS data are subject to quality limitations. The FASTR DQA module applies a systematic review of monthly data at the facility and indicator levels to identify and characterize these limitations. Results are summarized as annual estimates, which may reflect partial-year data depending on data availability at the time of analysis (for example, analyses conducted mid-year may include data only for the months available).

### Analytical rationale

Data quality directly affects the reliability of health indicators and coverage estimates. Before service utilization rates or population coverage are calculated, it is necessary to assess whether the underlying facility data are sufficiently reliable. This module identifies data patterns that may distort analytical results, allowing users to make informed decisions about data treatment in subsequent steps of the pipeline.

### FASTR approach to data quality

FASTR takes a multi-pronged approach, based on the belief that data quality should not be a barrier to data use. The approach emphasizes conducting granular, facility-level data quality assessments; focusing on high-volume indicators that produce more stable estimates; emphasizing variation over time and space rather than point estimates; and interpreting results collaboratively with in-country decision-makers. Using data and providing feedback is viewed as the first step toward improving data quality.

### Key points

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Raw HMIS data (`hmis_ISO3.csv`) containing facility service volumes by month and indicator<br>Geographic/administrative area identifiers<br>Standardized indicator names |
| **Outputs** | `M1_output_outliers.csv` — facility-month-indicator outlier flags<br>`M1_output_outlier_list.csv` — flagged outliers only (review list)<br>`M1_output_completeness.csv` — facility-month-indicator completeness flags<br>`M1_output_consistency_geo.csv` — sub-national consistency results by ratio pair<br>`M1_output_dqa.csv` — composite DQA scores (mean and pass/fail) |
| **Purpose** | Evaluate HMIS data reliability through outlier detection, completeness assessment, and consistency checking to ensure trustworthy inputs for coverage estimation |

!!! warning "Reminder: input must be counts, not percentages"

    This module expects **raw service counts** (e.g. number of visits, doses, deliveries reported by each facility each month). Percentages, rates, or pre-calculated coverage figures cannot be analysed here — outlier detection compares values against a facility's own volume distribution (a percentage capped at 100 has no signal), and completeness flags depend on whether a count was reported. See [Data extraction](02_data_extraction) for what to pull from your HMIS.

## Analytical workflow

### Overview of analytical steps

The module applies a structured sequence of data quality checks, progressing from individual observations to an overall assessment of data reliability:

**Step 1: Data preparation**  
Monthly facility reports are loaded and organized for analysis. Dates are standardized, and the geographic units and health indicators available in the dataset are identified.

**Step 2: Outlier detection**  
For each facility and indicator (for example, pentavalent vaccine doses or antenatal care visits), the module identifies unusually high values that may reflect reporting or data entry errors. Two complementary approaches are used: statistical outlier detection based on deviations from a facility’s historical reporting pattern, and proportional checks that flag months accounting for an implausibly large share of the facility’s trailing 12-month service volume for that indicator.

**Step 3: Completeness assessment**  
The module evaluates the consistency of facility reporting over time by constructing a complete reporting timeline for each facility–indicator combination and identifying missing months. Facilities with extended periods of non-reporting (six months or more) are classified as inactive rather than incomplete.

**Step 4: Consistency assessment**  
Related indicators are expected to follow predictable relationships. For example, the number of first antenatal care visits should exceed the number of fourth visits. The module assesses these relationships using indicator ratios calculated at the district level, reducing bias from patient movement across facilities, and flags deviations from expected patterns.

**Step 5: Indicator availability checks**  
Before consistency assessments are applied, the module verifies that the required indicator pairs are present in the data. Where indicators are missing, the analysis adapts to the available information without generating errors.

**Step 6: DQA score calculation**  
For a defined set of core indicators (typically first-dose pentavalent vaccination, first antenatal care visit, and outpatient department visits), results from the outlier, completeness, and consistency checks are combined into an overall DQA score. A facility–month receives the highest score only if all core indicators meet minimum standards across all three dimensions.

**Step 7: Outputs**  
The module generates a set of structured outputs, including outlier flags, completeness indicators, consistency results, and final DQA scores. These outputs are used in subsequent FASTR modules and provide a transparent basis for data quality review and improvement.

### Key decision points

**When is a value considered an outlier?**

Outliers are identified by assessing within-facility variation in monthly reporting for each indicator. A value is flagged as an outlier if it meets **either** of the following criteria:

1. The value exceeds 10 times the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the monthly median for the indicator; **or**  
2. The value accounts for more than 80 percent of the total reported volume for a given facility, indicator, and year **and** the reported count exceeds 100.

The MAD is calculated using only values at or above the median, in order to focus detection on unusually high values and avoid flagging low-volume observations.

**Why is consistency assessed at the district level rather than the facility level?**

Patients frequently seek care from different facilities within the same district depending on the service. For example, a woman may receive her first antenatal care visit at a primary health center but deliver at a district hospital. Assessing consistency at the district level accounts for this patient movement and provides a more accurate representation of service utilization patterns.

**What happens when required indicators are missing?**

The module adapts to the data that are available. If required indicator pairs for consistency assessment are missing, consistency checks are not applied, and the DQA score is calculated using only outlier and completeness dimensions. Analysis proceeds using the quality dimensions that can be assessed.

**How are inactive facilities handled?**

Facilities that do not report for six or more consecutive months at the beginning or end of their reporting period are classified as inactive for those months rather than incomplete. This prevents penalizing facilities that have not yet begun reporting or that have permanently ceased operations.

### Data processing and outputs

**Transformation overview**

The module transforms raw facility reports into quality-flagged datasets through the following steps:

1. **Input format**: Monthly observations with facility identifier, reporting period, indicator, and reported count  
2. **Enrichment**: Calculation of supporting statistics, including median values, MAD-based residuals, and proportional volume contributions  
3. **Completion**: Explicit generation of records for missing months, converting implicit reporting gaps into observable data points  
4. **Aggregation**: Aggregation of facility-level data to the district level for consistency assessment  
5. **Flagging**: Assignment of binary quality flags for outliers, completeness, and consistency  
6. **Scoring**: Combination of quality flags into continuous scores (0–1) and corresponding pass/fail indicators  
7. **Output format**: Production of multiple output files tailored to different analytical uses, including rapid outlier review, full data quality analysis, and inputs for downstream FASTR modules  

The module processes data in long format, with one record per facility–indicator–period combination, and outputs standardized data quality measures that are used by subsequent modules to inform data adjustment, weighting, or exclusion decisions.

## Detailed reference

This section provides technical details for implementers, developers, and analysts who need to understand the underlying methodology.

### Configuration parameters

The module uses several configurable parameters that control analysis behavior:

<details open>
<summary>Geographic settings</summary>


```r
# Country identifier
COUNTRY_ISO3 <- "GIN"  # ISO3 country code

# Geographic level for consistency analysis
GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_3"  # Admin level (1=national, 2=region, 3=district, etc.)
```

The `GEOLEVEL` parameter determines the aggregation level for consistency analysis. Lower administrative levels (3-4) capture local patterns but may have sparse data. Higher levels (2) provide more stable estimates but may mask local inconsistencies.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Outlier detection parameters</summary>


```r
# Proportion threshold for outlier detection
OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.8  # Flag if single month > 80% of the trailing 12-month total

# Minimum count to consider for outlier flagging
MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 100  # Only flag outliers with count > 100

# Number of Median Absolute Deviations for statistical outlier detection
MADS <- 10  # Flag if value > 10 MADs from median
```

**Tuning guidance:**
- **More sensitive detection**: Lower `OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` to 0.6-0.7, reduce `MADS` to 8
- **Less sensitive detection**: Increase `OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` to 0.9, increase `MADS` to 12-15
- **Small facilities**: Lower `MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD` to 50
- **Large facilities only**: Increase `MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD` to 200+

</details>

<details>
<summary>DQA indicator selection</summary>


```r
# Core indicators used for DQA scoring (default)
DQA_INDICATORS <- c("anc1", "penta1", "opd")

# Consistency pairs to evaluate (default)
CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED <- c("penta", "anc", "delivery")
```

**`DQA_INDICATORS` accepted values** (from the platform parameter): any subset of `c("anc1", "penta1", "opd")`.

**`CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED` accepted values** (from the platform parameter): any subset of `c("penta", "anc", "delivery", "malaria")`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Consistency benchmark ranges</summary>


```r
all_consistency_ranges <- list(
  pair_penta    = c(lower = 0.95, upper = Inf),  # Penta1 >= 0.95 * Penta3
  pair_anc      = c(lower = 0.95, upper = Inf),  # ANC1 >= 0.95 * ANC4
  pair_delivery = c(lower = 0.7, upper = 1.3),   # 0.7 <= BCG/Delivery <= 1.3
  pair_malaria  = c(lower = 0.9, upper = 1.1)    # Malaria indicators within 10%
)
```

The ranges reflect programmatic expectations. For example, ANC1 should always be at least 95% of ANC4 (more women start care than complete four visits). The 5% tolerance accounts for data entry variations. BCG, as a birth dose vaccine, should approximately equal facility deliveries, with 30% tolerance for variation.

<details>
<summary>outlier_analysis()</summary>

**Purpose**: Identifies statistical outliers in facility service volumes using dual detection methods

**Parameters:**

- `data`: HMIS data with facility_id, indicator_common_id, period_id, count
- `geo_cols`: Vector of geographic column names
- `outlier_params`: List containing:
  - `outlier_pc_threshold`: Proportion threshold (default 0.8)
  - `count_threshold`: Minimum count threshold (default 100)

**Returns**: Dataframe with outlier flags and diagnostic metrics for each facility-indicator-period

**Calculated fields:**

- `median_volume`: Median count by facility-indicator
- `mad_volume`: MAD calculated on values >= median
- `mad_residual`: Standardized residual (|count - median| / MAD)
- `outlier_mad`: Binary flag (1 if mad_residual > MADS)
- `pc`: Proportional contribution to the trailing 12-month total (rolling window ending at the row's period)
- `outlier_pc`: Binary flag (1 if pc > threshold)
- `outlier_flag`: Final flag (1 if either method flags AND count > minimum threshold)

**Algorithm steps:**

**Step 1**: Calculate median volume for each facility-indicator combination

**Step 2**: Compute MAD using only values equal to or above the median
- Avoids bias from facilities with many low-volume months
- Standardizes residuals by dividing (count - median) by MAD
- Flags outlier_mad = 1 if mad_residual > MADS parameter

**Step 3**: Calculate proportional contribution
- For each facility-indicator-period, sum the count over the trailing 12 months ending at that period (rolling window)
- Calculate pc = count / window_total (pc is NA if the window total is 0)
- Flags outlier_pc = 1 if pc > OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD
- This rolling-window denominator replaces a calendar-year denominator, which falsely flagged facilities whose only reporting fell early in a calendar year (their single month was its own denominator)

**Step 4**: Combine flags
- Final outlier_flag = 1 if (outlier_mad = 1 OR outlier_pc = 1) AND count > MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD
- The threshold (default 100) ensures only substantial volumes are flagged, avoiding false positives at low-volume facilities

```

**Scoring algorithm:**

**1. Completeness-Outlier Score** (per facility-period):
- Each DQA indicator scores 0-2 points (1 for completeness + 1 for no outlier)
- Maximum possible = 2 × number of DQA indicators
- Score = Total Points / Maximum Points

**2. Consistency Score** (per facility-period):
- Only counts pairs where both indicators exist (NA pairs excluded from denominator)
- Score = Number of passing pairs / Number of available pairs
- If no pairs available, score = 0

**3. Mean DQA Score:**
- Average of completeness-outlier score and consistency score
- Formula: `(completeness_outlier_score + consistency_score) / 2`

**4. Binary DQA Score:**
- 1 if all checks pass (complete, no outliers, consistent)
- 0 if any check fails

**Handling missing indicators:**
The function intelligently handles cases where some consistency indicators are missing:
- NA values in consistency pairs are NOT replaced with 0
- Only available pairs contribute to the denominator
- This prevents penalizing facilities for indicators they do not provide

**Example calculation:**

```
Facility X in period 202401:
- DQA Indicators: penta1, anc1, opd (3 indicators)
- Completeness: All 3 complete → 3 points
- Outliers: None → 3 points
- Total: 6/6 → completeness_outlier_score = 1.0

Consistency Pairs:
- pair_penta (penta1/penta3): Pass (1)
- pair_anc (anc1/anc4): Fail (0)
- pair_delivery: NA (bcg not a DQA indicator)

Consistency calculation:
- Available pairs: 2 (penta, anc)
- Passing pairs: 1 (penta)
- consistency_score = 1/2 = 0.5

Final scores:
- dqa_mean = (1.0 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.75
- dqa_score = 0 (not all pairs passed)
```

<details>
<summary>dqa_without_consistency()</summary>


**Signature**: `dqa_without_consistency(completeness_data, outlier_data, geo_cols, dqa_rules)`

**Purpose**: Calculates DQA scores using only completeness and outlier checks when consistency data is unavailable or no valid consistency pairs exist

**When used:**

- No consistency pairs defined in configuration
- All consistency pairs have missing indicators
- Dataset does not contain paired indicators

**Scoring:**

- Uses only completeness and outlier components
- `dqa_mean` = `completeness_outlier_score`
- `dqa_score` = 1 if all completeness and outlier checks pass, 0 otherwise

**Output structure:**

```r
dqa_results <- data.frame(
  facility_id,
  admin_area_X,              # Dynamic geographic columns
  period_id,
  completeness_outlier_score, # Range: 0-1
  dqa_mean,                   # Range: 0-1 (equals completeness_outlier_score)
  dqa_score                   # Binary: 0 or 1
)
```

### Statistical methods & algorithms

<details>
<summary>Median absolute deviation (MAD) calculation</summary>


The MAD is a robust measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers than standard deviation.

**Standard MAD Algorithm:**
1. Compute the median of the dataset
2. Calculate absolute deviations: |value - median| for each data point
3. Find the median of these absolute deviations

**FASTR Modification:**
The module calculates MAD using only values at or above the median, making it more sensitive to high outliers while avoiding bias from facilities with many low-volume months.

**Outlier degree calculation:**

$$
\text{MAD Residual} = \frac{|\text{volume} - \text{median volume}|}{\text{MAD}}
$$

**Outlier classification:**
- If MAD Residual > 10 (configurable via `MADS` parameter), the value is flagged as a MAD-based outlier (`outlier_mad = 1`)
- The final `outlier_flag` also requires count > 100

**Example:**

```
Facility ABC, Indicator: penta1
Monthly counts: 20, 25, 22, 28, 24, 26, 150, 23, 27, 25, 21, 24

Step 1: Calculate median = 24.5
Step 2: Values >= median: 25, 28, 24.5, 26, 150, 27, 25, 24.5
Step 3: Absolute deviations from median: 0.5, 3.5, 0, 1.5, 125.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0
Step 4: MAD = median(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 125.5) = 1.0
Step 5: For count=150: MAD residual = |150 - 24.5| / 1.0 = 125.5
Step 6: 125.5 > 10 AND 150 > 100, therefore outlier_flag = 1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Proportional outlier detection</summary>


This method identifies months where a single observation represents an unusually large proportion of the facility-indicator's reported volume over the preceding 12 months.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each facility-indicator-period, sum the count over the trailing 12 months ending at that period (rolling window per facility × indicator)
2. Calculate the proportion: `pc = monthly_count / window_total` (set to NA if the window total is 0)
3. Flag as proportional outlier (`outlier_pc = 1`) if `pc > OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD` (default 0.8)
4. The final `outlier_flag` also requires count > 100

**Rationale:**
A facility reporting 80% of its trailing-year volume in a single month likely indicates a data entry error (e.g., cumulative reporting instead of monthly, extra digit entered). The trailing 12-month window replaces an earlier calendar-year denominator: a facility whose only reporting fell early in a calendar year was previously its own denominator (pc ≈ 1.0) and was incorrectly flagged.

**Example:**

```
Facility XYZ, Indicator: anc1
Monthly counts (Jun 2023 – May 2024):
  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May
   15   18   12   16   14   17   13   16   15   14   12  890

For May 2024 (count=890):
window_total = 15+18+12+16+14+17+13+16+15+14+12+890 = 1052
pc = 890 / 1052 = 0.846
0.846 > 0.8 AND 890 > 100, therefore outlier_flag = 1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Consistency ratio benchmarks</summary>


The module applies programmatically defined benchmarks for indicator pairs:

**ANC Consistency:**

$$
\text{ANC Consistency} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \frac{\text{ANC1 Volume}}{\text{ANC4 Volume}} \geq 0.95 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**Interpretation**: More women should start ANC (ANC1) than complete four visits (ANC4). The ratio is expected to be ≥ 0.95, allowing up to 5% tolerance for data variations.

**Penta consistency:**

$$
\text{Penta Consistency} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \frac{\text{Penta1 Volume}}{\text{Penta3 Volume}} \geq 0.95 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**Interpretation**: More children should receive Penta1 than complete the three-dose series (Penta3).

**BCG/Delivery Consistency:**

$$
\text{BCG/Delivery Consistency} =
\begin{cases}
1, & 0.7 \leq \frac{\text{BCG Volume}}{\text{Delivery Volume}} \leq 1.3 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**Interpretation**: BCG is a birth dose vaccine, so BCG vaccinations should approximately equal facility deliveries. The wider range (±30%) accounts for infants born elsewhere receiving BCG at the facility or facility-born infants receiving BCG elsewhere.

**Implementation detail:**
Consistency is assessed at the district/ward level (specified by `GEOLEVEL`) to account for patients visiting multiple facilities within their local area for different services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Completeness calculation</summary>


For a given indicator in a given month:

$$
\text{Completeness} = \frac{\text{Number of reporting facilities}}{\text{Number of expected facilities}} \times 100
$$

**Expected facilities definition:**
A facility is expected to report for an indicator if it has ever reported for that indicator within the analysis timeframe AND is not flagged as inactive.

**Inactive facility definition:**
A facility is flagged as inactive for periods where it did not report for six or more consecutive months before its first report or after its last report.

**Example:**

```
District has 20 facilities that have ever reported penta1 data in 2024
In March 2024:
- 18 facilities submitted penta1 data
- 2 facilities did not submit (but are not inactive)

Completeness = 18 / 20 × 100 = 90%
```

**Important note**: A high level of completeness does not necessarily indicate that the HMIS is representative of all service delivery in the country, as some services may not be delivered in facilities or some facilities may not report. For countries where DHIS2 does not store zeros, indicator completeness may be underestimated if there are many low-volume facilities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>DQA composite score calculation</summary>


The DQA score combines three quality dimensions for a defined set of core indicators.

**Component scores:**

**1. Completeness-Outlier Score:**

$$
\text{Completeness-Outlier Score} = \frac{\sum (\text{completeness pass} + \text{outlier pass})}{2 \times \text{number of DQA indicators}}
$$

**2. Consistency Score:**

$$
\text{Consistency Score} = \frac{\text{Number of pairs passing benchmarks}}{\text{Number of available pairs}}
$$

**3. Mean DQA Score:**

$$
\text{DQA Mean} = \frac{\text{Completeness-Outlier Score} + \text{Consistency Score}}{2}
$$

**4. Binary DQA Score:**

$$
\text{DQA Score} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if all checks pass (complete, no outliers, consistent)} \\
0, & \text{if any check fails}
\end{cases}
$$

**Passing criteria for binary score:**
- ALL DQA indicators must be complete (completeness_flag = 1)
- ALL DQA indicators must be free of outliers (outlier_flag = 0)
- ALL available consistency pairs must pass benchmarks (sconsistency = 1)

**Example calculation:**

```
Facility 123, Period 202403
DQA Indicators: penta1, anc1, opd

Completeness: penta1=1, anc1=1, opd=1 → 3 points
Outliers: penta1=0, anc1=0, opd=0 → 3 points
Completeness-Outlier Score = 6 / (2×3) = 1.0

Consistency Pairs:
- pair_penta: 1 (pass)
- pair_anc: 1 (pass)
Consistency Score = 2 / 2 = 1.0

DQA Mean = (1.0 + 1.0) / 2 = 1.0
DQA Score = 1 (all checks passed)
```

### Code examples

<details>
<summary>Example 1: Running the module with default settings</summary>


```r
# Set working directory
setwd("/path/to/module/directory")

# Load required libraries
library(zoo)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)

# The module will automatically:
# 1. Load hmis_ISO3.csv
# 2. Run all analyses with default parameters
# 3. Generate output CSV files in the working directory

source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 2: Adjusting outlier detection sensitivity</summary>


```r
# Make outlier detection more sensitive (lower thresholds)
OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.6   # Flag if >60% of trailing 12-month volume (was 80%)
MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 50         # Consider counts >=50 (was 100)
MADS <- 8                             # Flag at 8 MADs (was 10)

# Run the module
source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
```

**Use case**: Countries with generally low service volumes where the default thresholds are too conservative.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 3: Different geographic level for consistency</summary>


```r
# Use district level (admin_area_2) instead of sub-district (admin_area_3)
GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_2"

# This affects consistency analysis aggregation level
source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
```

**Use case**: Sub-district level has sparse data or too few facilities per area, making district-level aggregation more stable.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 4: custom DQA indicators</summary>


```r
# Focus DQA on maternal health indicators only
DQA_INDICATORS <- c("anc1", "anc4", "delivery", "pnc1")

# Only evaluate anc consistency pair
CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED <- c("anc")

source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
```

**Use case**: Specialized analysis focusing on a specific service area.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 5: Running for different country</summary>


```r
# Configure for your country
COUNTRY_ISO3 <- "ISO3"  # Replace with your country code
PROJECT_DATA_HMIS <- "hmis_ISO3.csv"
GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_3"

# Adjust for country-specific indicators if needed
DQA_INDICATORS <- c("penta1", "anc1", "opd", "fp_new")

source("01_module_data_quality_assessment.R")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 6: Programmatic use of outputs</summary>


```r
# After running the module, work with outputs

# Load DQA results
dqa_results <- read.csv("M1_output_dqa.csv")

# Filter to high-quality facility-months only
high_quality <- dqa_results %>%
  filter(dqa_score == 1)

# Calculate percentage of facility-months passing DQA by district
quality_by_district <- dqa_results %>%
  group_by(admin_area_2, period_id) %>%
  summarize(
    total_facility_months = n(),
    passing_quality = sum(dqa_score == 1),
    pct_passing = 100 * passing_quality / total_facility_months
  )

# Identify facilities with consistently poor quality (never passing)
poor_quality_facilities <- dqa_results %>%
  group_by(facility_id) %>%
  summarize(
    months_analyzed = n(),
    months_passed = sum(dqa_score == 1),
    pct_passed = 100 * months_passed / months_analyzed
  ) %>%
  filter(pct_passed == 0)
```

</details>

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Problem: Module skips consistency analysis</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- Console message: "No valid consistency pairs found"
- M1_output_consistency_geo.csv has only headers
- DQA scores calculated without consistency component

**Diagnosis:**
Check that both indicators in each pair exist in your dataset:

```r
# Load your data
data <- read.csv("hmis_[COUNTRY].csv")

# Check available indicators
print(unique(data$indicator_common_id))

# Compare with required pairs
# For pair_penta: need "penta1" and "penta3"
# For pair_anc: need "anc1" and "anc4"
# For pair_delivery: need "bcg" and "delivery" (or "sba")
```

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust `CONSISTENCY_PAIRS_USED` to only include pairs with available indicators
2. Modify indicator names in your data to match expected names
3. Accept that DQA will be calculated without consistency component

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: All facilities flagged as outliers</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- Very high percentage of outlier_flag = 1 in M1_output_outliers.csv
- Most observations in outlier_list.csv

**Diagnosis:**
Your thresholds may be too sensitive for your data context.

**Solutions:**

1. Increase MAD threshold:

```r
MADS <- 15  # Increase from default 10
```

2. Increase proportion threshold:

```r
OUTLIER_PROPORTION_THRESHOLD <- 0.9  # Increase from 0.8
```

3. Increase minimum count threshold (focus on larger facilities):

```r
MINIMUM_COUNT_THRESHOLD <- 200  # Increase from 100
```

4. Review the data: Check if there are genuine quality issues requiring data cleaning rather than parameter adjustment

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: no DQA results generated</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- M1_output_dqa.csv is empty or has only headers
- Console message: "Skipping DQA analysis - none of the required indicators found"

**Diagnosis:**
None of the indicators specified in `DQA_INDICATORS` exist in your dataset.

**Solution:**
Check which DQA indicators are missing:

```r
# Load data
data <- read.csv("hmis_[COUNTRY].csv")

# Check which DQA indicators are missing
available_indicators <- unique(data$indicator_common_id)
missing_indicators <- setdiff(DQA_INDICATORS, available_indicators)
print(paste("Missing DQA indicators:", paste(missing_indicators, collapse=", ")))

# Available DQA indicators
available_dqa <- intersect(DQA_INDICATORS, available_indicators)
print(paste("Available DQA indicators:", paste(available_dqa, collapse=", ")))
```

Then update `DQA_INDICATORS` to include only available indicators:

```r
DQA_INDICATORS <- c("penta1", "anc1")  # Only use what's available
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: Consistency ratios seem incorrect</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- All consistency flags are 0 (inconsistent)
- Consistency ratios are unexpectedly high or low

**Diagnosis:**
The geographic aggregation level may be inappropriate for your data.

**Investigation:**

```r
# Load geographic consistency results
geo_cons <- read.csv("M1_output_consistency_geo.csv")

# Check distribution of consistency ratios
summary(geo_cons$consistency_ratio)

# Check sample sizes at geographic level
outliers <- read.csv("M1_output_outliers.csv")
geo_summary <- outliers %>%
  group_by(admin_area_3, period_id) %>%
  summarize(
    n_facilities = n_distinct(facility_id),
    total_volume = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
summary(geo_summary$n_facilities)
```

**Solutions:**

1. If geographic areas have very few facilities (1-2), use higher level:

```r
GEOLEVEL <- "admin_area_2"  # Use district instead of sub-district
```

2. If ratios are generally below 0.95 for ANC/Penta pairs, this may indicate genuine programmatic issues (high dropout) rather than data quality problems

3. Review the consistency benchmark ranges - they may need adjustment for your context:

```r
# Example: Allow higher dropout (lower ratio) for Penta
all_consistency_ranges$pair_penta <- c(lower = 0.85, upper = Inf)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: Completeness percentages seem low</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- High proportion of completeness_flag = 0 in M1_output_completeness.csv

**Diagnosis:**
This could be legitimate (poor reporting) or an artifact of how your DHIS2 stores zero values.

**Investigation:**

```r
# Load completeness data
completeness <- read.csv("M1_output_completeness.csv")

# Check pattern: Are there explicit zeros or just missing values?
outliers <- read.csv("M1_output_outliers.csv")
table(is.na(outliers$count), outliers$count == 0)

# Check completeness by indicator
comp_by_indicator <- completeness %>%
  group_by(indicator_common_id) %>%
  summarize(
    pct_complete = 100 * mean(completeness_flag == 1),
    pct_incomplete = 100 * mean(completeness_flag == 0)
  )
print(comp_by_indicator)
```

**Considerations:**
1. If your DHIS2 does not store zeros, low-volume facilities may appear incomplete when they legitimately had no services to report
2. Completeness percentages should be interpreted in context - 70% completeness may be acceptable depending on the health system
3. Use the completeness_flag in subsequent modules to weight estimates appropriately

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: Error reading input file</summary>


**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Cannot open file 'hmis_[COUNTRY].csv'"
- Module crashes during data loading

**Solutions:**

1. Check file path and working directory:

```r
getwd()  # Verify working directory
list.files()  # Check if HMIS file is present
```

2. Verify file name matches `PROJECT_DATA_HMIS` parameter

3. Check file format (CSV, proper encoding, comma-separated)

4. Ensure required columns exist:

```r
# After loading
names(data)  # Should include: facility_id, period_id, indicator_common_id, count
```

</details>

### Usage notes

<details>
<summary>Interpretation guidelines</summary>


**Outlier flags:**
- outlier_flag = 1 suggests potential data quality issues, but require investigation
- Not all flagged outliers are errors (genuine service campaigns can trigger flags)
- Use mad_residual and pc values to prioritize review

**Completeness:**
- Completeness % varies by health system context
- 80-90%+ is generally good, but depends on country
- Trend over time more informative than absolute percentage
- Low completeness for specific indicators may reflect genuine service gaps

**Consistency:**
- sconsistency = 0 may indicate data quality issues OR programmatic performance issues (e.g., high dropout)
- Requires programmatic knowledge to interpret
- Geographic patterns can help distinguish systematic issues from random errors

**DQA Scores:**
- dqa_score = 1 indicates data passed all checks, suitable for unadjusted use
- dqa_score = 0 requires further investigation
- dqa_mean provides nuanced view (0.75 = mostly good, 0.25 = mostly poor)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Choosing which outputs to review</summary>


**For initial assessment**:

- Start with DQA summary heatmaps to identify areas/indicators with issues
- Focus on high-volume indicators (ANC1, Penta1, Delivery) which are more reliable
- Review completeness trends over time before point estimates

**For deeper investigation**:

- Use outlier detail files to see specific flagged values
- Cross-reference consistency issues with programmatic knowledge
- Compare patterns across adjacent geographic areas

**Priority order**:

1. Completeness - affects whether data represents the full picture
2. Outliers - directly distort aggregate statistics
3. Consistency - may indicate systemic issues or data entry problems

</details>

<details>
<summary>Limitations</summary>


**Statistical limitations**:

- MAD-based outlier detection assumes roughly symmetric distributions
- Consistency thresholds (98th percentile) may need context-specific tuning
- Completeness assessment requires accurate facility master list

**Interpretation caveats**:

- Not all flagged issues are errors (campaigns, outbreaks cause genuine spikes)
- Consistency failures may reflect programmatic issues, not data quality
- Geographic aggregations can mask facility-level variation

**Data requirements**:

- At least 6 months of data recommended for stable outlier detection
- Facility identifiers must be consistent across periods
- Missing geographic identifiers limit subnational analysis
